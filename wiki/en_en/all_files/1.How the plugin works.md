### 1. Island generation

Automatic creation :
The plugin automatically generates islands on every Minecraft region file (note that this is not a Folia region).

Space Optimisation:
It can rebuild an island in a free location, avoiding the need to continually increment island locations. This feature
is designed to optimise the use of storage space.

### 2. Space and Resource Management

Spacious islands:
Thanks to its ability to use storage space efficiently, the plugin enables the creation of particularly spacious
islands.

### Resource savings:

By avoiding wasting storage space, the plugin also saves system resources.

### 3. Easy island restoration

Backup and Restore:
It is possible to easily restore an island using a previous backup. Restoration is as simple as knowing the island's
region file and performing a copy/replace.

### 4. Skyblock-oriented design

Basic functionality :
The plugin is designed to work on the generic aspect of what a skyblock is, without extravagant additions.

Extensions vs Basic Functionality:
The idea is to focus on adding functionality via extensions rather than the core plugin. This approach aims to make it
easier to isolate and temporarily disable specific problems, rather than having to shut down the whole system because of
a bug. These points highlight how the plugin enhances the gaming experience in Minecraft, focusing on space
optimisation, ease of island management, and a modular approach to adding functionality.
